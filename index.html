        <h1>Welcome to Inputi Global LLC</h1>
        <p>
            We are a UAE-based wholesale distributor of organic and high-quality food products sourced from East Africa. 
            Our commitment is to connect UAE and Gulf region markets with healthy, traceable, and ethically sourced food.

    <section id="about">
        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
            Our products are carefully sourced from certified pack-houses who ethically source from smallholder farmers 
            and local cooperatives across Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda, ensuring not just quality but also direct 
            social impact through fair trade.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to our commercial activities, Inputi Global brings deep insight into East Africa's agricultural 
            and trade landscape. Our team works not only with private sector players across the value chains, but also 
            partners with governments in designing and strengthening sustainable food systems. This unique positioning 
            allows us to catalyze trade delegations, support bilateral and multilateral trade engagements, and authenticate deals.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are a socially and environmentally responsible company, actively promoting adherence to ESG (Environmental, 
            Social, and Governance) principles among all players along the value chains.
